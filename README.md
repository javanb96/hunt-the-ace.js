# JavaScript Practice
Building a card game to improve JavaScript skills. JavaScript is the dominant language for client-side web functionality. Here we will use JavaScript to creat a browser-based basic card game. JavaScript is mandatory to learn for Web Development because it is a core technology that can operate on the client and server-side. I can use this template to create more sophisticated card games like blackjack or poker. We will use HTML, Vanilla JavaScript, Basic CSS and Visual Studio Code. This tutorial will help practice creating dynamic user interactive code using Vanilla JavaScript. We will use animation effects, Responsive Layout design with CSS with CSS Grid, Flexbox and media queries. How to dynamically change the positions of grid cells so as to randomize the positions of the cards contained in a CSS grid using JavaScript local storage, and more.

The game we will develop is called hunt the ace. So we have four cards one of which is the Ace of Spades. the user clicks the play game button to start the game. the cards are flipped over that the user can no longer see the face of the cards. our game then randomize the positions of the cards so the cards are in effect shuffled . the cards are then positioned at random locations in a grid layout. each location corresponds to a randome whole number between one and four. The user can then guess where the user thinks the Ace of Spades is by clicking on the relevant card. once the user has clicked he chosen card the card then flips over and tells the user if they have won or lossed. Each game consists of four rounds. in each round the user attempts to guess the Ace of Spades location. If the user fails to guess the location of the card the user will not be rewarded any points for that round. If the user guesses correct the user is awarded points based on the round number.

The cards were pulled directly from the github repository using original links, but were downloaded for purposes of viewing.

## This tutorial not only covers creating a basic card game using JavaScript but also:
**how to create dynamic user interactive code using vanilla JavaScript**
**Creating some animation effects**
**Responsive layout design using CSS grid, CSS FlexBox and media queries**
**How to dynamically change the positions of grid cells, so as to randomize the positions of the cards contained in a css grid using JavaScript,
localStorage functionality**
**and much moreâ€¦**

## Here are the sections in this course:

**Getting Started**
**Live Server Extension**
**Create Cards - HTML**
**Create the Game Play Grid**
**Create Cards Dynamically - JS Code**
**Initialise Card Positions**
**Load Game and Start Game**
**Stack Cards**
**Flip Cards**
**Shuffle Cards**
**Deal Cards**
**Choose Card**
**Styling and Layout**
**Animation**
**Responsive Layout**
**Local Storage**

We will be creating the cards dynamically through Javascript code
and appropriately add the cards to the document object model.
